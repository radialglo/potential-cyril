/* ==== IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS ==== */
We implemented the arp, routing and icmp.
However there is a bug with the icmp.

EDIT:
We fixed the bug with the icmp. We were copying the old ip header into
the icmp data field instead of the new one.

Our code is mostly in sr_cache.c and sr_router.c.

After fixing the bug, the type 3 and type 11 (unreachable and time exceeded)
works properly, before it doesn't at all.
